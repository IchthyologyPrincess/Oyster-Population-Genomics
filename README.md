Population genomics of Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in the Northern Gulf of Mexico using Low-Coverage Whole Genome sequences. 

# Abstract
Along the southern coast of the United States, especially in Louisiana, the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is a key resource for fisheries and ecosystem functioning. Oysters protect the coast by acting as a natural infrastructure against coastal erosion and storm impacts. They are very effective at keeping coastal waters clean, filtering up to approximately 50 gallons of water a day each (NOAA Fisheries 2022). Oysters also have a large economic impact on Louisiana with the commercial oyster industry providing thousands of jobs and contributing over 300M dollars annually. With climate change rapidly altering many of the worldâ€™s coastal ecosystems, it is vital to understand how C. virginica reacts to these rapid environmental changes, however responses of individual populations may differ if they are locally adapted to environmental gradients in temperature or salinity. In this paper, we use low coverage whole genome sequencing from a total of 109 individuals across five populations in Louisiana and Northern Texas to investigate fine-scale population differences and genome environment associations for temperature and salinity. ANGSD was used to estimate genotype likelihoods, call SNPS, estimate Genotype posterior probabilities, and estimate a genetic covariance matrix for each individual of each population.Then R was used to analyze and visualize the data from the covariance matrix and .geno files. We found fine scale genetic structure across populations of C. virginica in Louisiana and Texas. Results from this project have important implications for population-specific management of this species in the Gulf of Mexico.
